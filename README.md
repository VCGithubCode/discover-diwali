## **🎅 About the Submission**
### **Intro**

Our project, Discover Diwali, embraces the spirit of **Hack the Holidays**  by bringing the celebration of Diwali to life through an interactive, engaging, and educational experience. By combining technology with cultural storytelling, we have created a platform that allows users to explore the rich traditions, stories, and regional delicacies of Diwali across India. Through an interactive map, users can click on different states to discover unique Diwali customs, watch short videos, and take quizzes that test their knowledge of the festival’s cultural significance. The use of a progress tracker and customizable avatars adds a fun, gamified element, making learning about Diwali both informative and entertaining. 

What makes Discover Diwali unique is its focus on personalization and accessibility, ensuring that users can explore the diversity of Diwali celebrations in an immersive and user-friendly manner. By incorporating features like a global leaderboard, custom avatars, and a quiz to unlock after completing the state-specific stories, our project creates a dynamic and engaging environment for all ages. Whether you're familiar with Diwali or just discovering it, Discover Diwali offers a fun, inclusive way to learn about one of the most vibrant festivals in the world.


### **Goal**

The **Goal** section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

- 🎄 **Problem Statement:** Many people around the world are unfamiliar with the diversity and cultural significance of Diwali. While this festival is widely celebrated in India, its traditions, regional variations, and stories are often unknown outside of those who celebrate it. There is a gap in making this cultural celebration more accessible and engaging for people of all backgrounds.

- 🎄 **Objective(s):** Our project, Discover Diwali, aims to bridge this gap by creating an interactive and educational platform where users can explore the traditions, stories, and regional customs of Diwali. Through an engaging map, quizzes, and videos, we aim to provide an immersive experience that teaches people about Diwali’s cultural importance and allows them to learn in a fun, gamified manner.

- 🎄 **Target Audience:** Our target audience includes people of all ages, from children to adults, who are curious about Diwali, its customs, and its cultural significance. Whether someone is already familiar with Diwali or learning about it for the first time, Discover Diwali caters to anyone interested in learning more about this vibrant festival. The project is particularly beneficial for educators, students, and families who want to introduce their children to the festival.

- 🎄 **Benefits:** Discover Diwali brings the holiday season to life by creating an inclusive and educational space where users can explore the festival's rich traditions, regiona



# Project Overview 

"Diwali Discovery" is an interactive educational app where kids explore an interactive map of India and learn how Diwali is celebrated in different Indian states. Each state reveals a short video or story write-up about the unique way Diwali is celebrated in that region. Kids can also click on a "Lessons Learned" link for each state, which takes them to a summary of the key cultural and historical insights for that region. As kids complete the exploration for each state, they earn progress points, and a progress bar shows how much they have explored. Once all states are explored, kids unlock a Diwali Quiz, which tests their knowledge. Completing the quiz places them on a global leaderboard, encouraging competition and learning.

#  **💻Development Process**
## Agile Methodology
## Sprint Process and Team Workflow
At the beginning of each sprint, our team conducts Sprint Planning to set the course for the upcoming work. This process includes:
- Prioritizing the Product Backlog: We ensure the most important tasks are addressed first, focusing on features and improvements that bring the most value to users.
- Setting Sprint Goals: Clear goals are established, aligned with project milestones, to provide direction and ensure we stay on track.
- Assigning Tasks: Tasks are distributed based on each team member’s expertise and workload to promote efficiency and collaboration.
Throughout the sprint, we carefully manage trade-offs between scope, quality, time, and resources. Our aim is to deliver high-quality work while meeting deadlines and user needs. By adopting Agile methodologies, we remain adaptable, focused, and committed to continuous improvement.
### Ongoing Daily Meetings:
After the initial meetings, our team continued with two daily sessions:
- Sprint Planning Meeting (10:00 AM): During this meeting, we:
  - Provide status updates on tasks.
  - Assign or reassign tasks based on each team member’s progress and workload.


- Retrospective Meeting (6:00 PM): 
  - At the retrospective, we reflect on the sprint, evaluate what went well, and identify areas for improvement to ensure smoother workflows and a more efficient development process.
### Informal Meetings:
Throughout the day, team members can meet informally and make decisions without the presence of the full team or SCRUM lead. These meetings are facilitated through Slack, where status updates on tasks are shared, and decisions are communicated to keep the project board updated.
## Kanban Board for Task Management
To manage and visualize the workflow, we use a Kanban board. This tool helps us track the progress of tasks across different stages of development. Tasks are moved through the following columns:
- To Do: Tasks that need to be started.
- In Progress: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
- Review: Completed tasks that are being reviewed or tested.
- Done: Fully completed tasks.
By using the Kanban board, we ensure that tasks are organized and transparent, making it easy for team members to see the overall project status and ensure that work is progressing smoothly.
