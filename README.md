# Project Overview 

"Diwali Discovery" is an interactive educational app where kids explore an interactive map of India and learn how Diwali is celebrated in different Indian states. Each state reveals a short video or story write-up about the unique way Diwali is celebrated in that region. Kids can also click on a "Lessons Learned" link for each state, which takes them to a summary of the key cultural and historical insights for that region. As kids complete the exploration for each state, they earn progress points, and a progress bar shows how much they have explored. Once all states are explored, kids unlock a Diwali Quiz, which tests their knowledge. Completing the quiz places them on a global leaderboard, encouraging competition and learning.

## Agile Methodology
## Sprint Process and Team Workflow
At the beginning of each sprint, our team conducts Sprint Planning to set the course for the upcoming work. This process includes:
- Prioritizing the Product Backlog: We ensure the most important tasks are addressed first, focusing on features and improvements that bring the most value to users.
- Setting Sprint Goals: Clear goals are established, aligned with project milestones, to provide direction and ensure we stay on track.
- Assigning Tasks: Tasks are distributed based on each team member’s expertise and workload to promote efficiency and collaboration.
Throughout the sprint, we carefully manage trade-offs between scope, quality, time, and resources. Our aim is to deliver high-quality work while meeting deadlines and user needs. By adopting Agile methodologies, we remain adaptable, focused, and committed to continuous improvement.
### Ongoing Daily Meetings:
After the initial meetings, our team continued with two daily sessions:
- Sprint Planning Meeting (10:00 AM): During this meeting, we:
  - Provide status updates on tasks.
  - Assign or reassign tasks based on each team member’s progress and workload.


- Retrospective Meeting (6:00 PM): 
  - At the retrospective, we reflect on the sprint, evaluate what went well, and identify areas for improvement to ensure smoother workflows and a more efficient development process.
### Informal Meetings:
Throughout the day, team members can meet informally and make decisions without the presence of the full team or SCRUM lead. These meetings are facilitated through Slack, where status updates on tasks are shared, and decisions are communicated to keep the project board updated.
## Kanban Board for Task Management
To manage and visualize the workflow, we use a Kanban board. This tool helps us track the progress of tasks across different stages of development. Tasks are moved through the following columns:
- To Do: Tasks that need to be started.
- In Progress: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
- Review: Completed tasks that are being reviewed or tested.
- Done: Fully completed tasks.
By using the Kanban board, we ensure that tasks are organized and transparent, making it easy for team members to see the overall project status and ensure that work is progressing smoothly.

## Collaboration Tools
The team used [Slack](https://slack.com/) for quick collaboration purposes and Github projects to track User Stories, Bugs and Time plan.
The Team used slack team channel Canvas to ensure everyone stayed updated on project progress and discussions. [canvas](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/canvas/C080JB3ETHU)
